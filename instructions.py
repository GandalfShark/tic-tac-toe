Implement the following features:

the board should be stored as a three-element list,
while each element is another three-element list (the inner lists represent rows)
so that all of the squares may be accessed using the following syntax:

board[row][column] #done

each of the inner list's elements can contain 'O', 'X', or a digit representing
the square's number (such a square is considered free)
the board's appearance should be exactly the same as the one presented in the example. #done

implement the functions defined for you in the editor. -- kinda

Drawing a random integer number can be done by utilizing a
Python function called randrange(). The example program below
shows how to use it (the program prints ten random numbers from 0 to 8). #done

Note: the from-import instruction provides access to the randrange
function defined within an external Python module called random.
